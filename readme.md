# Development Branch SocialNetwork 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreas83/SocialNetwork.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/andreas83/SocialNetwork)

Note:
This is a complete rewrite of SocialNetwork 1.2.1 

## Why a complete rewrite? 

The old PHP Code is based on my own framework which was a good learning curve for me, but not very helpful for others. 
Also the react frontend  became more and more unmaintainable, since it was just a experiment for me to play around with it. 

## Status

Right now there is more or less an empty lumen project.
I started writing first db migrations for content, hashtags and users.
Also first content get controller is in progress. 

Help with all the frontend work would be highly appreciated. 

## Versions

Since this is a complete rewrite new Version will start with x.0.1

## Ideas ? 

Quite a lot, feel welcome to join the development process.
