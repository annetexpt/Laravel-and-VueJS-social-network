# Development Branch SocialNetwork 

Note:
This is a complete rewrite of SocialNetwork 1.2.1 


 ## Why a complete rewrite? 
 
 The old PHP Code is based on my own framework which was a good learning curve for me, but not very helpful for other. 
 Also the react frontendparts became more and more unmaintable, since it was just a experiemnt for me to play arround with it. 
 
 ## Status
 
 Right now there is nothing more than an empty laravel project. 
 I will write some migration scripts for the old database shema, so it will become backward compatibile at least to some extends.

 ## Versions
 
 Since this is a complete rewrite new Version will start with x.0.1
 
 ## Ideas ? 
 
 Quite a lot, feel welcome to join the developmemt process.
