# Development Branch SocialNetwork 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreas83/SocialNetwork.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andreas83/SocialNetwork)

Note:
This is a complete rewrite of SocialNetwork 1.2.1 


 ## Why a complete rewrite? 
 
 The old PHP Code is based on my own framework which was a good learning curve for me, but not very helpful for other. 
 Also the react frontend  became more and more unmaintainable, since it was just a experiment for me to play around with it. 
 
 ## Status
 
 Right now there is nothing more than an empty laravel project. 
 I will write some migration scripts for the old database schema, so it will become backward compatible at least to some extends.

 ## Versions
 
 Since this is a complete rewrite new Version will start with x.0.1
 
 ## Ideas ? 
 
 Quite a lot, feel welcome to join the development process.
